<p>Sometimes programming with PHP and trying to redirect pages with <em>header("location:".$site);</em> , it's possible to get the following warning:<br />
<strong>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent</strong><br />
This may occur for one of those reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the file with (or including a file which starts with):
<pre lang="php" line="1">
<?php // the code starts here, above there's a whitespace
</pr?>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Having previously in the script (or including a file which have it) whitespaces :
<pre lang="php" line="1">
<?php // some example code...
?>

<?php // more example code lines...
?>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Print or echo of a variable or text before sending headers.</li>
<li>HTML code before sending headers.</li>
<li>A mix of  the above reasons...</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, depending on PHP version, everything seems to be okay but when you run the script, it doesn't work. Let's see an example:</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /full/route/to/file/which/previously/has/sent/headers/included.php:xx) in <strong>/full/route/which/has/sending/header/script.php</strong> on line <strong>xx</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>script.php</strong> there is eg. <em>header("location:script2.php);</em> and apparently headers has sent before in <strong>included.php</strong>.</p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>included.php</strong></span>:</p>
<pre lang="php" line="1">
<?php // code
if ($lang== "es")
{
	include("spanish.inc.php");
}
elseif ($lang== "en")
{
	include("english.inc.php");
}
// more code
?>
</pre>
<p>Imagine your error is on  include("spanish.inc.php") and obviously the included file is ok (eg. empty). Then why there's an error? Some php versions or apache/iis configurations, make an include (or require, require_once, ...) works as an output buffer. To avoid that, just wrap the "conflictive" code with:</p>
<p><strong>ob_start();</strong><br />
// code which have include or require, etc.<br />
<strong>ob_clean();</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, finally In <strong>included.php</strong>:</span></p>
<pre lang="php" line="1">
<?php // code
ob_start();
if ($lang== "es")
{
	include("spanish.inc.php");
}
elseif ($lang== "en")
{
	include("english.inc.php");
}
ob_clean();
// more code
?>
</pre>
