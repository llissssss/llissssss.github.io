<p>For people not very used to design a site (or the ones who are not focused in frontend development), to use a CSS Framework could be very useful. I'm one of these, and in my case I 've to say that is at least, easier than starting from scratch.</p>
<p>As youÂ could have seen with the title of the entry, I've used <a title="Twitter Bootstrap on github" href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> . It has been my second time using it, and I must say that it has been again a nice framework to worh with. I've used also the Responsive feature again, because almost the 25% of the people who visited my blog site, use mobile devices.</p>
<p>I'm not going to tell or describe the features that it offers or how make it works, because it is very easy to use and provide <del>almost</del> all the CSS styles that you would need in the frontend development of a site, and some scaffolding to get started with.</p>
<p>Summarizing, I can assert that I would use it in my future projects.</p>
