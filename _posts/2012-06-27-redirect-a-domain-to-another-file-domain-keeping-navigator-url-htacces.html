<p><strong>Situation</strong>:<br />
You have a site (eg.<em> www.mysite.com</em>) and a page of this site dedicated to photography (eg. <em>www.mysite.com/photography.html</em>) . For some reason you buy another domain (eg.<em> www.photosite.com</em>) and want to render your <em>photography.html</em> page below this new domain.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Use a <a title="htaccess manual" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html" target="_blank">htaccess file</a> running <a title="Apache site" href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache server</a> to solve that. How?</p>
<pre lang="apache">Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^$ photography.html [L]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.photosite.com/$1 [P]</pre>
<p>And upload it to you new domain renaming the name to <em>.htaccess</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First rule will redirect <em>www.photosite.com</em> to <em>www.photosite.com/photography.html</em></li>
<li>Second one will "render" every<em> www.mysite.com/any-site-page.html</em> under domain <em>www.photosite.com</em>, and keeping this url domain even navigating between different pages (that's why there's a [P], standing for <em>Proxy</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you you find it useful.</p>
