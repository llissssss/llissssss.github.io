I am currently managing a mission-based team at [Personio]. 

Previously I worked as a Team Lead and Engineering Manager at [Qualtrics], [Wayfair] and as a Software Engineer in multiple companies (B2B/B2C Startups as well as Consultancies promoting SOLID principles, clean code techniques, KISS and a customer-first approach.

I have led and worked in multiple international teams in Belgium, Germany and Spain. I strongly believe in building autonomous teams as the only path to success.
