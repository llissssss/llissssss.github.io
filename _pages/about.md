I am currently leading a team of six people at [Clarabridge]. 

Previously I worked as an Engineering Manager at [Wayfair] and before that as a Software Engineer in multiple companies
promoting SOLID principles, clean code techniques and the often dismissed KISS principle.

I have led and worked in multiple international teams in Belgium, Germany and Spain. I strongly believe in building
autonomous teams as the only path to success.
